<p>To work on the project fork the repository in your own Raceup GitHub
profile.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>#[no_std] must remain and you are not allowed to use any external
library.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>what does it mean to use #[no_std] in a rust project and why may
it be necessary?</p></li>
<li><p>what does it mean to extern crate alloc; in a rust project and
why may it be necessary?</p></li>
<li><p>define a trait that represents a Mex with the following functions
where data and id are generic parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>new(id,length,data): return a new Mex</li>
<li>id(): given a Mex return its id</li>
<li>dlc(): given a Mex return its length</li>
<li>data(): given a Mex return its data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>define a trait that represent the usage of a generic bus
where</p>
<ul>
<li>the trait has a generic parameter
<P>
with the constraint that
<P>
has to implement the Mex trait</li>
<li>the following functions must exist: - new: initializes a new bus
returning the object that implements the trait - send: use the object
that implement the trait, take a
<P>
type and send it in the bus. return a Result with type () if Ok and
Err(&amp;str) if some errors occur - receive: use the object that
implement the trait, return a
<P>
type populated with the data obtained from the bus</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Implement the following protocols with the trait above:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAN base (id 11-bit)</li>
<li>Serial For each implementation define some unit-testing where you
define at least one function for each function defined in the
implementation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry if you don’t complete.</p>
